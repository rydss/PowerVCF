<a href="https://code.vmware.com/apis/723/vmware-cloud-foundation" target="_blank">VMware Cloud Foundation API Documentation</a>

## Compatibility
This branch is compatible with VMware Cloud Foundation 3.x starting at 3.8. For VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x please use the latest release-2.x branch as the API authentication changed.

# Disclaimer
This is not an officially supported VMware PowerShell Module. It was initially developed and maintained by Brian O'Connell who is a Staff Architect in the VMware HCI Business Unit (HCIBU).

The purpose of this module is to make VMware Cloud Foundation API more accessible to fans of PowerCli and drive adoption of the VMware Cloud Foundation API & VMware Cloud Foundation in general. It is provided without warranty and should not be used in a production environment without thoroughly testing first. It has been developed against VMware Cloud Foundation 3.9 and best efforts will be made to validate all cmdlets against future VMware Cloud Foundation versions but no promises!

## Supported Platforms
This version has been tested using vSAN Ready Nodes. VMware Cloud Foundation on VxRail has not been fully tested, The following cmdlets will not work with VxRail as the workflow is different due to the use of VxRail Manager. _Other cmdlets may work subject to testing._

`Commission-VCFHost`

`Decommission-VCFHost`

All Network pool actions

New/Set/Remove Workload domains


## Installing the module
Tested in Windows PowerShell 5.x & PowerShell Core 6.x

To install the module from the PowerShell Gallery Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following

```PowerShell
Install-Module -Name PowerVCF
```

Alternatively to manually install the module download the full module zip from the GitHub repo, extract and run the following in PowerShell

```PowerShell
Import-Module .\PowerVCF
```

## Getting Started
All API operations must currently be authenticated using the SDDC Manager admin account.
To create a base64 credential to authenticate each cmdlet you must first run:

```powershell
Connect-VCFManager -fqdn sddc-manager.sfo01.rainpole.local -username admin -password VMware1!
```

*Note: `-username` & `-password` are optional. If not passed a credential window will be presented.*

Authentication is only valid for the duration of the PowerShell session.

Managing Credentials (password retrieval/update/rotation) requires dual authentication using a privileged username & password. See here for setup instructions: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/3.9/com.vmware.vcf.admin.doc_39/GUID-FAB78718-E626-4924-85DC-97536C3DA337.html
